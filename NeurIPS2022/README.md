# Split-kl and PAC-Bayes-Split-kl Inequalities for Ternary Random Variables
This repository contains the code needed to replicate the experiments
- Ensemble of heterogeneous classifiers in Appendix E.3 of the preprint [1]
- Random forest (RF) in Appendix E.4 of the preprint [1]

## Usage
To run the experiments, run `make`. This will download the data [7,8,9] needed for the experiments.
Experiments can now be run by using the `optimize.py` python script in the folder. See the files for how-to. Output files will be created in directory `out/`.
The experiments can be run as follows:

* Optimization of RF: `make optimize_rfc`
* Optimization of heterogeneous classifier ensemble: `make optimize_mce`

## Plots
After running the experiments, the plots and LaTeX tables of the paper can be generated by `cd`ing to the `plots` directory and running:

* Plots for optimized RF: `make optimize_rfc`
* Plots for optimized heterogeneous classifier ensemble: `make optimize_mce`

Output figures will be generated in the subdirectories `figure`.
